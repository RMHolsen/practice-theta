Created Theta, initialized git and committed to GitHub. 
Used 'create-react-app' and then rm -rf .git within the front-end folder to make the front-end folder appear on GitHub without conflict.
Order of operations there is very important otherwise you have a git in a git and that is a git too much. As yet there is no option to create a react app using CRA without an innate git repo. Ugh.

Spent some time arguing with React and reading on the hot-reloading issue. This is balls. 
Will npm run start -FAST_REFRESH=true work? We shall see. Otherwise this is going to be exhausting. 
No. No it does not. (Or maybe I need the .env file.) This is going to be exhausting. 
Created PushDaButton Component
Created ClickyButton Component
Created RandomArt Component and artData data to feed it. This one might eventually get deployed.
Created RandomColor Component. This one might also get deployed so I can pick a freaking color for my eyeshadow.
